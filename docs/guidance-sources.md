## Assisted digital (summary)

From [Assisted digital support: an introduction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/assisted-digital-support-introduction):

- Everyone who needs the service must be able to use it; some users need help with the online part (trust, confidence, access, skills, motivation).
- Support may be phone, in person, or sometimes webchat.
- Research assisted digital needs; do not assume none exist without evidence.
- This template’s UI work does not replace assisted digital planning.

## Design System + Frontend

- Components and patterns: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/
- Technical install, Nunjucks, fixture HTML testing, browsers: https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/
- **Latest Frontend release (always before upgrading):** https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/latest
- Prefer Nunjucks macros over copy-pasted HTML; extensive fixture parity for backend output
- Local playbooks: [creating-components.md](creating-components.md), [testing-components.md](testing-components.md), [upgrading-govuk-frontend.md](upgrading-govuk-frontend.md)

## How agents should use this list

1. Open or search the relevant URL for the question.
2. Apply the guidance to the **backend + GOV.UK Frontend** shape of this template (no competing UI frameworks).
3. Record wrapper-specific decisions in [tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md).
4. Keep [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) slim — put lasting detail under `/docs`.
