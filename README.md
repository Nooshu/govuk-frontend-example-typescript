**TypeScript** specialised line of the GDS-compliant frontend template: **Node + TypeScript** generates HTML; **[GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/)** macros (**prefer Nunjucks**) — **no** React/Vue/Angular/Svelte for UI. Official fixtures enable **100% HTML parity** of TypeScript output vs every fixture `html`.

## Priorities

Frontend web performance → frontend security → reduced maintenance → accessibility → inclusive design.

## Quick local checks

```sh
npm install
npm run build:styles    # Sass → dist/stylesheets/application.css
npm start               # build:styles, then example pages and component demos
npm test                # baseline, Sass pipeline, fixture parity, and service tests
npm run verify          # docs + build:styles + typecheck + tests
npm run sync:template   # pull shared docs/dotfiles from the agnostic template
```
